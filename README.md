Cross-platform Ð²epositary receipts
==================================

Thank you for your interest in our project.


We develop a system of symmetrical two-sided depository contracts. One of the contracts receiving token and regulation for receipt issue, makes an escrow of received tokens and transfers the regulation to the depository contract on the needed platform. This contract receiving the regulation issues receipts for the corresponding number of original tokens. Receipts are tokens standard for their platform and they are not limited in circulation. If needed, the owner of a receipt can make a vice versa transaction: to transfer receipt to the depository and to receive original tokens. If this token is a token of the app, the receipt can be redeemed and simultaneously a token can be transferred to this app. In this way for tokens the differences between platforms disappear.
